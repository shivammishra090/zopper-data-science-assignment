# Zopper Data Science Internship Assignment

## Project Overview
This project analyzes device insurance attach percentage data for a retail store chain (Jumbo & Company).  
The objective is to understand store, branch, and month-wise trends, identify performance gaps, and predict attach percentage for January to support business decision-making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
- Branch information
- Store names
- Monthly device sales data
- Monthly insurance attach percentages

Attach percentage represents the proportion of customers purchasing insurance plans such as Screen Protection, Extended Warranty, and Accidental Damage along with devices.

## Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Branch-wise attach percentage analysis
- Store-wise performance comparison
- Month-wise trend analysis
- Store categorization (High / Average / Low performers)
- January attach percentage prediction using trend-based approach

## Prediction Approach
January attach percentage is predicted at store level based on historical trends and average attach percentages, assuming continuity of customer behavior and no major external changes.

## Key Insights
- Significant variation exists across stores and branches
- Some stores consistently outperform others
- Low-performing stores present opportunities for improvement
- Month-wise fluctuations suggest possible seasonality or promotional impact

## Business Recommendations
- Focused training for low-performing stores
- Replication of best practices from high-performing stores
- Sales incentives linked to attach percentage
- Continuous monitoring of attach percentage trends

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn 
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
